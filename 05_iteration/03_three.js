// for of
// The for...of statement executes a loop that operates on a sequence of values sourced from an iterable object. Iterable objects include instances of built-ins such as Array, String, TypedArray, Map, Set, NodeList (and other DOM collections), as well as the arguments object, generators produced by generator functions, and user-defined iterables.
// ["", "", ""]
// [{}, {}, {}]

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for (const num of arr) {
    //console.log(num);
}

const greetings = "Hello world!"
for (const greet of greetings) {
    //console.log(`Each char is ${greet}`)
}

// Maps
//The Map object holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion order of the keys. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.
// Map objects are collections of key-value pairs. A key in the Map may only occur once; it is unique in the Map's collection. A Map object is iterated by key-value pairs â€” a for...of loop returns a 2-member array of [key, value] for each iteration. Iteration happens in insertion order, which corresponds to the order in which each key-value pair was first inserted into the map by the set() method (that is, there wasn't a key with the same value already in the map when set() was called).
const map = new Map()
map.set('IN', "India")
map.set('USA', "United States of America")
map.set('Fr', "France")
map.set('IN', "India")


// console.log(map);

for (const [key, value] of map) {
    //console.log(key, ':-', value);
}



const myObject = {
    game1: 'NFS',
    game2: 'Spiderman'
}

//output show not iterable
// for (const [key, value] of myObject) {
//     console.log(key, ':-', value);
    
// }
